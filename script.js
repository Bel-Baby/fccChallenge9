const getMean = (array) => {
    //The mean is the average value of all numbers in a list. The first step in calculating the mean is to take the sum of all numbers in the list. Arrays have another method, called .reduce(), which is perfect for this situation. The .reduce() method takes an array and applies a callback function to condense the array into a single value.Declare a sum variable and assign array.reduce() to it.
    const sum = array.reduce((acc, el) => //Like the other methods, .reduce() takes a callback. This callback, however, takes at least two parameters. The first is the accumulator, and the second is the current element in the array. The return value for the callback becomes the value of the accumulator on the next iteration.For your sum variable, pass a callback to .reduce() that takes the accumulator and the current element as parameters. The callback should return the sum of the accumulator and the current element.
        acc + el, 0 //The .reduce() method takes a second argument that is used as the initial value of the accumulator. Without a second argument, the .reduce() method uses the first element of the array as the accumulator, which can lead to unexpected results.To be safe, it's best to set an initial value.Set the initial value of the accumulator to 0.
    );

    const mean = sum / array.length;
    return mean;

//You can actually cleanup the logic above a bit. Using the implicit return of an arrow function, you can directly return the value of the .reduce() method divided by the length of the array, without having to assign any variables.Update your getMean function as described.

const getMedian = (array) => {
    //The first step in calculating the median is to ensure the list of numbers is sorted from least to greatest. Once again, there is an array method ideal for this â€“ the .sort() method.Declare a sorted variable and assign array.sort() to it. There is one last thing to fix. The .sort() method mutates the array it's called on. It is generally bad practice to mutate a function parameter, which array is.To fix this, add an empty .slice() call before your .sort() method. The empty .slice() call will make a shallow copy of the array, which you are free to mutate.
    const sorted = array.slice().sort((a, b) => //By default, the .sort() method converts the elements of an array into strings, then sorts them alphabetically. This works well for strings, but not so well for numbers. For example, 10 comes before 2 when sorted as strings, but 2 comes before 10 when sorted as numbers.To fix this, you can pass in a callback function to the .sort() method. This function takes two arguments, which represent the two elements being compared. The function should return a value less than 0 if the first element should come before the second element, a value greater than 0 if the first element should come after the second element, and 0 if the two elements should remain in their current positions.To sort your numbers from smallest to largest, pass a callback function that takes parameters a and b, and returns the result of subtracting b from a. 
        a - b);

    //The next step is to find the number in the middle of the list. If the list has an odd number of numbers, the middle number is the median. If the list has an even number of numbers, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.You can check if a number is even or odd with the modulus operator, which is represented by the % symbol. This operator returns the remainder of the division of two numbers. If the remainder is 0, the number is even. If the remainder is 1, the number is odd:Declare a median variable. Using the ternary operator, check if the length of array is even. If the length of array is even, find the two middle numbers and calculate the mean of those numbers. If the length of array is odd, find the middle number and assign it to the median variable.
    const median = array.length % 2 === 0 ? getMean([sorted[array.length / 2], sorted[array.length / 2 - 1]]) : sorted[Math.floor(array.length / 2)];

    //Finally, return the value of median.
    return median; //Like the getMean function, you could condense this code into one line and reduce the number of variables you instantiate. However, it is important to remember that shorter code is not always better code. In this case, reducing the lines of code would make the code harder to read and understand, impacting future maintainability.

    //There are a few edge cases to account for when calculating the mode of a dataset. First, if every value appears the same number of times, there is no mode.To calculate this, you will use a Set. A Set is a data structure that only allows unique values. If you pass an array into the Set constructor, it will remove any duplicate values.Start by creating an if statement. In the condition, create a Set with new Set() and pass it the Object.values() of your counts object. If the size property of this Set is equal to 1, that tells you every value appears the same number of times. In this case, return null from your function.

Chain the .sort() method to your Object.keys() call.For the callback, you'll need to use the counts object to compare the values of each key. You can use the a and b parameters to access the keys.

Otherwise, the mode is the number that occurs most often, that single number is the mode.Thankfully, you can handle both of these cases at once with the .filter() method.
